Font Design Report for Children Aged 5-7

1. Introduction

This report explains the design and purpose of a new font created specifically for children aged 5 to 7. The goal is to enhance early literacy by providing clear, friendly, and easy-to-read letterforms that encourage young readers.

2. Font Design Overview

The font features rounded, simple characters with ample spacing between each letter. This design approach reduces confusion between similar-looking characters (like 'b' and 'd') and makes reading easier for beginners. Each letter is crafted to be easily recognizable and visually distinct.

3. Design Justification

Rounded Characters: Rounded shapes make the font more approachable and reduce the sharpness that may distract or confuse young children.
Clear Letterforms: The font is designed to avoid unnecessary complexity, making each character easier to recognize.
Increased Spacing: Slightly wider spacing between letters helps prevent crowding and makes the text easier to follow.
Playful Style: The fontâ€™s playful, soft look keeps children engaged with the material, creating a fun and encouraging reading experience
